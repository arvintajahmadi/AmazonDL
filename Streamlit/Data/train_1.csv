I had a tight space between a desk and window to mount the TV so I wanted something that could move and this fit the bill. I was a little worried about the one stud mounting design but I made sure to find my stud properly in the wall with a stud finder and use a small nail to poke the wall to find the true edges of the board. Once I did that it was some measure to find where it would sit on the wall as far as TV height. Measure twice and drill once. I drilled the holes for the bracket on the wall starting with the top hole and using a level when marking the bottom hole. I put the lag bolt in the top hole first part way and then again used the level when putting the bottom bolt. Before tightening it down all the way I used the level one last time to get it level to my comfort level. Was done the bracket felt solid on the wall. I then mounted the bracket on the TV with fit perfect on the VESA mounts without using the extension arms that came in the kit. The kit was missing one bolt of the M8-15 bolts but luckily the M8-30 bolts fit into the bottom holes of my TV without being too long so I didn't have to contact Amazon about the missing bolt but was a little disappointed about that. Some quick screw driver work on the mount was on with the washers provided. I adjusted the tilt of the mount to face the TV down for my situation and realized I got it backwards once we lifted the TV but that was just an honest eyeball mistake. Some quick turns with the provided allen wrench to adjust the tilt and back on the wall it went. I tighten the one mounting bolt that holds it on and we are good to go. I adjusted the arm to where I wanted the TV and it felt was very solid. The articulating arms were a little stiff without the TV on their but once I put the 35lb TV on it moved fine, done want a loose swing mount. I didn't experience any sagging or off level issues. It is a two person job for heavy TVs to mount them but I did all the mount work on the wall and TV alone and only needed help with lifting the TV on to the wall when ready.

I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs. I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it. (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.

Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine. Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims. I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install. Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem. The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force. Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.

I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises. An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount. If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).

It's quite cheap now, plus it can last a long time between battery charges.  I've had a Nook ST for 3+ years, and it can get pretty close to a month between charges, depending on level of use.

That's the best of both worlds, if you have separate books on your Nook or Amazon accounts and want to combine them all together in one device.

Also I need something that could go a long time on a single charge. None of the full tablets were going to cut it and than I discovered the paper white.

And he was not into petite, intelligent women.  Let me tell you... there were lots of tingles in this book!

Specifically, I didn't get this for books but for art, I wanted to get a little light  like this so I could draw more easily in areas with dim lighting, I don't always like drawing in my desk area and this is perfect! The neck is so very flexible, moves very easily, the clamp expands pretty wide, it is very bright and the two brightness settings are great. I highly recommend it but this will probably be too bright for some depending on the reasons for wanting to use it.","Really great, might be too bright for some!",1480982400

On the positive side, this particular model #44812 HammerHead design is plenty bright... but so is the ""dim"" option.  The less-bright of the two settings is still very bright, with very little noticeable change in brightness.","Bulky, with a dim setting that is still bright.",1479686400

I usually use the low setting.  I do adjust it slightly depending on which page I am reading but the neck is very flexible.  Better than any book light that I have ever had.  It doesn't work very well for magazines and newspapers as the whole setup bends the pages.

A big thank you to Soundcraft for putting a usb port on the signature series mixers!  (intended to charge your smartphone I think). Rare to find any kind of light connection on a small mixer but nice to see these guys changing with the times. Everything should be made with a usb port or two these days! What a great bang for the buck this little lite is (and less here than from the online music stores).

Figured Mighty Bright was a familiar name so better to start here than run through the gamut of off brand lites. If any issues develop I'll be sure to update this. Check out the pics.... beats me babbling on.

It takes one AAA, very cheap to replace. The battery lasts for many, many days with frequent use. The light itself lasts a long time. I bought this one to replace one just like it that I got so many years ago I can't tell you just how old it was. It works well in books, too, as it's not too heavy to use on a paperback.

The fold-up clip has been most functional for me as a stand so that I can set it standing on it's side, directed toward my Kindle while lying on my side to read.
It's small, light-weight and compact, so it's great for travel too.
I looked at a lot of other designs, and tried a few. This one is by far the best design for my needs.
I was hoping for something not quite so bright because I don't like the idea of diminishing my melatonin production right before I go to sleep.

First, it's a bit smaller and lighter than other lights I've owned, much better for paperbacks. More importantly, though, is the light it gives off. It seems so much brighter than other book lights with more bulbs, and it seems to cast light in a wider area, allowing me to cover both pages at the same time. PLUS, I love that it is not rechargeable. I have another, much more expensive book light that I just threw away because I can't find the stupid charger.

The light cast is a pleasant warm light, of about the perfect brightness.  I've been using it for about two weeks now, approx 30-60 minutes per night, and have not yet run through the first set of batteries.

My only fault is that the bendable neck is a tad short, I find that I need to clip the light to the side of my pages to get sufficient illumination across the page without having the bright pinpoint of the led shine in my eyes.  I am also concerned a bit by the battery usage... I opted for this less expensive model though, and knew what I was ordering.

I will be ordering the rechargeable version today, it appears to have a slightly longer neck and not needing new batteries every so often should be a plus.","Very well built light, excellent value for the price",1453420800
