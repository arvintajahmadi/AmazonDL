It is supposed to be a conversion tray for a laptop optical drive.  I assumed that you would be able to remove the old drive and replace it with this new card.  However, this is far from the case.  The engineers who created this device either use different laptops than the rest of us, or they designed it for a desktop.  There is no way that I am going to pull apart my laptop to connect this device.  I don't even have the proper ports on my laptop's motherboard.

I'm a computer savvy guy.  I've repaired many laptops and other devices over the years, so if there were some easy modification that I could do to this device to make it work, then I would do it.  However, that is not the case.

For the life of me, I don't know what these folks were thinking when they designed this.  If I wanted to install USB 3 on a desktop, I wouldn't do it through the optical drive!  I would get a dedicated card for that.

However when I tried to get a refund on the protection plan so far I have been unable to after a week of trying.  I created an account on their site and it found my protection plan and information and everything and I went through the process on their website to cancel the plan and get a refund only to come back with a system error and have it tell me to call their support people in India.  So I called and the guy I spoke to told me that even though I have the Care ID number from their own website as well as my order number from Amazon plus all my other account information, they could not find the warranty in their system.  He told me to give it a couple of days and hopefully it would be in there and call back and then I should be able to get issued my warranty.  So the following week I hadn't heard anything so I went on their website to try again and of course it failed and gave me the phone number to call which I did and this time I spoke to some Indian woman and she still could not find it to be able to issue a refund.  So she made me e-mail them a copy of the invoice for both the protection plan and the security camera system and told me to try back in another 2 days.  So that is where I am right now, its been a week and I have made no progress in getting my refund and they can't seem to look up the protection plan in their system even though I can go on their website and look it up myself.

4,3.0,True,2016-08-17,A194Y8P8TVT7P9,B00P7G82TS,,Mark,"I bought one of these and have regretted it ever since. The GPS receiver worked for a day and a half before crapping out and making any and all navigation and location-aware apps useless. I've tried on trips of several hours, and the unit never finds the *receiver*, much less satellites. (There are two separate messages when it's working properly; first it finds the receiver, then looks for satellites.) The bluetooth stack doesn't include serial port profile, so my bluetooth GPSr doesn't help and the unit won't recognize USB GPS receivers, so that's not a solution either. I've tried using my phone's GPS, but it's a huge hassle because every time I turn on the car I have to start separate (and different) apps on both the phone and the stereo before navigation apps can be started, and it's unreliable and iGo keeps saying ""GPS signal lost"" even though it's not. The built-in weather widget on the homescreen apparently doesn't recognize the external GPS and hasn't updated in over a year even though it has Internet through my phone's hotspot. The WiFi never worked worth a flip - it has to be 10 feet from the router to get a signal.

I sent the unit into Pumpkin for a replacement, but all they did was add a little wire antenna (which gives me about 5 foot more range, still practically useless) and claim there was nothing wrong with the GPS. I've been back and forth with them for over a year, and they're always friendly and ""helpful"", except the only real help would be to just replace the unit with one that's not defective and they refuse.

Also, this unit is VERY deep. It's over 2 inches (5 cm) deeper than my factory CD stereo, far deeper than necessary for the optical disc player, and too deep for my dash. It's sort of installed but it forces the dash piece out and makes the gap more than .25 cm. The only way to fix it would be to cut out a support in the back of my dash, which I'm not willing to do for this hunk of junk. Don't buy this unless you have at least 7.5 inches of depth behind your dash.

This can pair with many phones, but it can only connect with one at a time, so if you have a partner only the driver can connect with the stereo if you're both in the car. That means you can't both have handsfree and the driver can't have handsfree phone while the passenger fiddles with video or audio on their device.

The bluetooth OBDII adapter that I bought from Pumpkin also is a hunk of junk. It makes my car buck and sputter. I can't use it at all, making Torque and any other OBDII apps also useless.

Also, good luck with Android 5.1 - mine is still 4.4 and shows no sign of finding an update.

Stay very, very far away from Pumpkin brand.

11,,False,2017-11-17,A1V1JORLMK4RA9,B01AOBOAWS,,dobetter,"Summary of Prestige model: Seemingly good build quality. Design met my needs perfectly. Fans are very noisy for non-gaming/low-stress applications. Only one person works in technical support/RMA department.

I bought the ""Prestige"" model directly from Swiftech to cool my CPU (i 7700K) and GPU (1080 Ti). I didn't mind paying extra for the highly rated Noiseblocker NB-eLoop fans because my primary focus is on quiet operation. However, the fans turned out to be the big roadblock to quiet operation. The version of the NB-eLoop fans used with this have a minimum RPM of 800. That's more than double most similar fans in that quality/price range. What that means is, that unless your computer is in a room with lots of ambient noise, you're going to hear the fans running even if your rig is sitting idle. I found this so annoying that I would have sent the unit back if I could have. Instead, I had to replace those expensive yet noisy fans with something more suitable (Noctua NF-F12). With the Noctua's, unless I'm gaming, I get excellent cooling while running the fans at around 450rpm and I can't hear them unless I literally press my ear against the case. As a bonus, the Noctua's also ran quieter than the NB eLoops under heavy gaming loads.

Two of the four CPU waterblock mounting posts would not thread properly into the mounting bracket. When I called Swiftech for replacements I was told their ONE tech support/RMA person wasn't at work that day (Monday). So I emailed them as suggested and their response went to my spam folder (very strange) where I didn't think to look for it until the afternoon of the following day (Tuesday). They then asked for a picture of the part I needed even though I used their part number and was quite clear about what I needed and why. After receiving my photo of the two defective screws/posts they sent replacements via regular mail. The combined delay of the tech not being available for a day, asking for photos they don't need, and sending the parts regular mail instead of priority was 5 days. That was a bit hard to swallow when all I needed was fifty cents worth of parts and after spending $200 they couldn't send them overnight or at least priority mail.

I had the best results by replacing the fans, not using the PWM splitter, and setting separate profiles for the water pump and fans. After some tweaking I now have silent cooling for everything but gaming and very quiet for even the most demanding games (Witcher 3 on ultra for example). Works great now after spending an extra $40 for good fans and skipping the PWM splitter. I'll likely try another company next time around.

UPDATE: On day four after installation the reservoir started leaking... At this point I'd love a refund but I'm guessing I'll have to go through the RMA process until I get a good unit.

UPDATE 2: After discovering a leak which turns out to be odd cracks in the reservoir, it took Swiftech nearly 36 hours to respond to my request for help. When they did they asked for 5 things (in order to help), 4 of which I had provided in my original request for assistance. It doesn't seem like they're paying attention to detail or perhaps their ONE tech support/RMA person isn't strong on English or lacks strength in reading comprehension. So, even thought the unit was defective upon arrival, I'm having to return it for RMA at my own expense. More to come as the likely drama unfolds...

UPDATE 3: So finally, 3 weeks (and change) after receiving my initial order I now have a functional unit. Things to know: they sent me mounting hardware for the CPU block 3 times. Every set of hardware had defective parts, but I was able to combine them to come up with one complete working set. Even thought the unit was defective when I received it, I had to pay to ship it back to them. I asked the same tech support person multiple questions over multiple emails and only received an answer to one of them. However, the answer was not correct/not true.

Now I have to decide if I trust the product enough to leave it running in my case or toss it in the trash...","Noisy Fans, Poor Tech Support, Defective Hardware, AND Leaks!",1510876800

My wife got it for me because I lose my keys and phone in the house a lot. The idea sounded good enough: locate keys from the phone, and locate phone from the key fob. So far so good.

I am in no way a tech newbie. I worked in tech for 15 years. Our whole house is full of devices from desktops to mobile devices, with a wifi system and network I set up myself. That said, this product is an incomprehensible mess -- specifically, the android app to control it. They have packed on so many layers of useless crap in the app and the device, like using the Mynt as a remote control, that they neglected to provide clear instructions and buttons on the app to perform the basic tasks of locating your phone or device. I have honestly never seen such a disorganized app before. FAQs are jammed into the last half of some menu, and most of the FAQ address useless stuff like cloud functionality and never actually tell you how to set up and use this thing. I do realize that if I devoted a few hours to sort it all, I could figure out how to make it work, but ... who has the time for that? The app needs to be redesigned FROM THE GROUND UP, like, from scratch.

I get a bluetooth connected/disconnected message on my phone every few minutes, even with the device right next to it. The phone is constantly alerting me to status changes and ""do you know where you keys are?"" messages. There is no obvious way to stop them; it's incredibly obnoxious. The app drains power from my phone faster than an other app I've used.

This company needs to take its clever tech and zest for innovation, and hire some real UI people. They have neglected UI and the end user in the pursuit of cool tech. This is not a workable consumer product.

Because the camera keeps turning off and on, there is a chance that it would not be able to capture a possible accident and that makes this camera completely unreliable.

69,19.0,False,2016-09-12,A2Z9APP5B09MFY,B01CF07L54,{'Size:': ' 49 inches'},Nicholas,"I have to say, this is probably one of the worst 2016 4K TVs you could possibly get. There are more negative qualities than there are positive, so I'll shine some light on what are the only good features this TV does have.
For one, LG uses an IPS display so regardless of the angle you sit, you still get the same even picture quality. However, IPS screens require more light power which causes terrible light bleeding, poor contrast and even worse black levels if it's not done right. Samsung used an IPS screen on there 55JS7000 and it wasn't the best as the 50"" and 60"" version. Sony is also experimenting with IPS screens, and those models that do have an IPS screen are one of their worst models, and be picture quality just don't look like that of the Sony's we are use to seeing.
LG has pretty good upscaling, and I will say it's on par with pretty much all the other top brands such as Samsung and Sony. Vizio has one of the worst upscaling features, and it's across the board with all their models.
Now for the negatives, the UH6100 uses a terrible RGBW panel which gives you a less accurate pixel structure, which causes a dramatic dip in picture quality across the board no matter the source or the quality. Instead of the standard Red, Green and Blue pixel structure, LG substituted most of the sub pixels to include a white pixel which causes the picture to look strange, especially text. It may not be an issue from far away, but up close its definitely noticeable.
Since this TV uses an IPS display, light bleeding is an issue because this TV has no local dimming and because there is no local dimming, the contrast and black level level is also terrible. This causes dark scenes in movies to look gray when it should be black, and this is more noticeable if you watch TV in a dark room or at night.
The UH6100 provides a some what good performance with motion. It has a 60Hz panel which at most can interpolate 30 fps content, so you wouldn't get the full benefit of 4K at 60fps. Motion blur is also okay, with only a short trail following moving objects. Movies played over a blu-ray player experience no judder, this can not be said about movies being played from streaming or cable as it can not understand the signal being sent. Blu Rays and DVDs play at 24p, and believe it or not some cheap 4K TVs don't even detect that signal. This TV can, so movies from Blu Ray and DVD play smoothly without the need of TruMotion other wise known at the Soap Opera effect that some people hate. I'm not one of those people, but there are people who want a TV that can play a movie smooth like the director wanted, without that Soap Opera effect LEDs give. What some people don't know is this a thing you turn off in the settings, all LEDs have this on and off switch for it.
However, if you are one of those that plan on turning it off I may look else where. This TV can not detect 24p from 60p or 60i sources. So if you like to stream from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime or watch movies from Cable the TV can not understand the source and judder will be present. I tested it out, and even with the TruMotion turned on and the De-Judder set as high as it can, I can still see the judder.
The price of this TV is a good one, however I feel like if LG had used a standard RGB panel display I would have rated this higher.",Probably one of the worst 4K TVs you could get.,1473638400

1) Hub falls off the network approximately every day, but at random times. We have to re-associate it each time.
2) Hub and remotes periodically, but randomly ~ once every two months, fall out of ""sync"" with each other, and we have to find a smart device to basically set the whole !*$ thing up again.
3) Harmony ""software"" for windows requires live internet AND being logged in to your account, to be able to do anything. It's slow. Who would write an app that requires constant live connection and login? I suspect Logitech is gathering, then selling, viewing behavior and the login allows association of that data with a demographic. Smart, but evil. I'm sure it says so in the 1200 page EULA that I would have to hire an attorney to figure out..
4) The overall amount of regular work we invest in making and keeping this ""ultimate"" solution, is greater than taping all of our remotes to a board.
5) It's absurdly expensive for what it does (and doesn't do).
6) Touch screen remote battery life is, and always has been, something like a few days. Make sure you put the charging stand, and plug-in power supply, on or near your seating. Seems a bit non-remotish requirement. Could have put in much more battery in a device of that size.
7) Keyboard works for some things on the Roku, but not on others. Also falls ""out of sync"" regularly.
8) IR ""mini-blasters"" are on very long, very thin wires that very delicate, and require clever placement to hide the wires and make the LED keep line-of-sight to the remotes.
9) USB power connector to the hub became flaky within a few months, and now requires the USB connector to be slightly cocked with light pressure to maintain the power. Duck tape to the rescue, but looks like crap.
