# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon
In this project, we used the Amazon reviews and advertisements data gathered by the project owner to answer two different DL-based problems in a group work.
My main contribution to the project was done in the second part.

This project was done in 2 weeks by a group of 2 and it was scored 99.5/100 by the project owner's (Quera IT Consulting and Education) auditing team.

## Image Classification
In this question we used different Image Classifiers such as Efficient net, Resnet and Convex models to predict the class of each Image in 10 groups getting a 71% micro F1-Score in the final test designed by the auditing team.

## Sentiment Analysis
In this problem we tries to analyze the feelings of reviewers and find out about their score (from 1 to 5) toa specific product.
In the process we handled imbalancement, preprocessed the text data and used different baseline and pre-trained models to ensure we will maximize the results accuracy.
